# About

I thought it would be neat to get the RGB LEDs in my Corsair keyboard and mouse to copy or mirror what is on-screen (a bit like Sony Bravia TVs that have a backlight that changes according to what's on-screen). 

Turns out Corsair have a python SDK for iCue (https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk-python) so this is my first attempt. I'm surprised with how well it worked! 

I have an MSI motherboard and want to eventually apply the same principle, but I can only find the MSI Mystic Light SDK in C++ or C#. I'm not familiar with either, but I'd hope to be able to handle the main computation in python and import/export led values. Tbc, will be a while before I look into that.
